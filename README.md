Marketplace where users can post products that they no longer use (cars, property, electronics)


A Marketplace created with Python Django where users can post products that they no longer use (cars, property, electronics, etc).

As a seller, users can effortlessly post their items, set competitive prices, and manage their listings. On the other hand, buyers can explore various categories and locations, finding unique second-hand treasures. The direct contact feature allows them to reach out to sellers via phone number easily.
